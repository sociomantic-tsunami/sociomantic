## Our Commitments

### 1. People at Sociomantic Labs

Sociomantic’s success depends on us, the people who form this company and contribute to its growth and evolution. As a global company, we embrace diversity, which gives Sociomantic its unique character. We want to create an environment of equality and inclusion where each of us is valued, well-treated and encouraged to reach their individual potential.
We have the right to fair, courteous and respectful treatment by our colleagues. Any kind of discrimination or harassment (such as intimidation, hostility, humiliation, degradation or insult) is strictly forbidden.
We make decisions on the basis of fair and objective criteria, such as job-related skills, achievements and performance, and always irrespective of age, disability, national origin, religion, political beliefs, ethnicity or race, sexual orientation, gender identity or other protected characteristics.We protect and promote our health and well-being and take safety topics seriously. We are encouraged to identify areas for improvement and to contribute continuously for a better working environment. We do not perform work duties under the influence of illegal drugs or alcohol.
In every country we operate in, we provide fair pay and healthy working hours. Where appropriate, we use flexible working hours and part-time roles to enable each of us to achieve the right work-life balance.### 2. Ethical Work Products

We will not knowingly create unethical work products which contain offensive statements, suggestions or images and will carefully consider the potential impact our work may have on other people. We will not undertake work which is intended or designed to mislead, discredit, or harass.### 3. Sustainability and Social Responsibility

We contribute positively not only to our industry but also to society at large and the environment. We respect human rights and we minimize our environmental footprint. We support community organizations and employee development. We maintain the highest standards of marketing ethics. We contribute to the community of open source software with passion.### 4. Integrity towards Customers, Suppliers and Partners

Our relations with customers, suppliers and other business partners reflect our mutual respect, honesty and fairness. We do not tolerate any kind of fraudulent, deceptive or otherwise dishonest behavior. Decisions towards our business partners are based on factual reasons, such as quality, reliability and competitive pricing.### 5. Conflicts of Interest

We keep private interests and motivations clearly separated from the interests of the company. We don’t compete with Sociomantic’s business. We don’t do business on behalf of Sociomantic with a company from which we or our family members might benefit unfairly. None of us owns more than 1% of the shares of any competitor, supplier or other organization which regularly deals with Sociomantic, if the relationship with Sociomantic could lead to a personal conflict of interest.### 6. Competition

We are committed to fair competition. Growing Sociomantic in competitive markets and helping our clients to do the same is the lifeblood of our business. We strictly refrain from agreements (formal or informal) which lead to illegal restriction or distortion of competition.
When dealing with competitors, we particularly refrain from exchanging information about current or future purchase or selling prices, margins, sales practices, geographical markets, market shares, certain customers or sources of supply.
When dealing with customers – and particularly agencies – we do not expect them to resell our services at specified prices. We do not take any action to unfairly favor a customer against another customer who competes with them.### 7. Laws and Regulations

We will always comply with all applicable laws, regulations and trading restrictions in every country Sociomantic does business in. This includes our commitment to respect the rights of any individual or legal entity, including personal rights to dignity and freedom as well as property and intellectual property rights. ### 8. Accurate Accounting

We are committed to comply with local and international financial reporting rules, as well as Tesco Group’s internal reporting policies. We are committed to complying with anti-money laundering laws and regulations. This means we will not knowingly accept any object, including payment, which is the proceed of an unlawful act as governed by applicable anti-money laundering laws.### 9. Prevention of Bribery and Corruption

As a business, we adopt a zero tolerance approach to bribery and corruption. We never offer or accept payments, gifts, entertainment or any other benefit to or from the representative of any customer, supplier, government agency, or other institution in order to secure any illegal or unfair benefit. We expect everyone who works with us, including contractors and agents, to do the same. We strictly follow our Sociomantic Expense Policy, as well as dunnhumby’s Global Anti-Bribery Policy and Global Gift and Entertainment Policy.### 10. Company Resources

We use company hardware, software and physical amenities responsibly and in accordance with our Security Policy.### 11. Confidential Information and Personal Data

Any confidential information we receive from customers, suppliers and other third parties, will be kept confidential. Likewise, any information that relates to our business and contains business secrets will be kept confidential.
Those of us with access to confidential information will neither pass such information to any external third party (including family members and friends) nor to people employed with Sociomantic without a business-related need to know, unless authorized by the information provider.

Where necessary, we ensure that the information has been encrypted in accordance with our Security Policy before sending it to an external contact. We are mindful of the risk of discussing confidential information in public places. Our alumni respect their post-contractual confidentiality obligations.
We process all personal data in line with all applicable data protection laws and regulations. Protection of personal data is secured by Sociomantic’s designated data protection officer. Every one of us has been informed of and pledged to our obligation to protect and maintain the confidentiality of personal data.
We do not use confidential information for purposes other than providing our services. We are not allowed to use or disclose non-public information concerning investments, disinvestments, profits, and other facts relevant to the share price ("Insider Information") of Tesco PLC and entities that are directly or indirectly controlled by Tesco PLC ("Tesco Group") to enrich ourselves or others. We refrain from dealing in the shares of any supplier, customer or Tesco Group company on a short-term basis if we are in possession of Insider Information.### 12. Corporate Identity and ReputationOfficial statements and publications, in particular to the public media, are only published by the authorized employees of our marketing and communications teams and should be done so in line with the Sociomantic Style Guide. When expressing our personal opinion on social media platforms and similar publicly-available channels we make sure that our posts are identifiable as being a personal opinion and not necessarily the opinion of Sociomantic.
We never share confidential, false or misleading information and take into account the potential effect that our communications may have on Sociomantic and the Tesco Group. We will consider the potential for customers or work to damage Sociomantic’s or the Tesco Group’s reputation prior to taking them on. This includes reputational damage from association with clients that participate in activities that contribute to the abuse of civil rights.### 13. Politics

As a company, we have no political affiliations and we do not make political donations to parties or candidates. We respect our mutual rights to be politically active, as long as this is kept separate from work duties and doesn’t influence behavior towards customers and colleagues.## Speak Up
