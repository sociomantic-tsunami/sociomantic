# Sociomantic

## Overview

This repo is intended to hold cultural and process-related materials from inside of Sociomantic Labs. They will be documents and ideas that we believe can benefit other individuals if shared. As a happy artifact to release of our internal ways we hope to foster more exposure and encourage anyone to provide feedback and insights. After all, learning from each other is one of the best ways to grow.

## Versioning

Based on the unique model of this repository it will not itself be controlled with semantic versioning. Individual documents or collections of documents will be, though. Please review to their own README files for more information.

## Code of Conduct

Our [Code of Conduct](Code of Conduct.md) is intended to create a safe and enjoyable working atmosphere for our employees internally as well as our fellow beings externally as well.
